   <h1>A little bit about Abbirielle..</h1>
   <p>My name is pronounced Ab-ree-ell, but close friends and family call me Abbi!</p>
   <h2>Some basics</h2>
   <p> This is where I would typically enter my favorite color, maybe favorite animal? Only, I dont really think theres anything basic about myself... I dont have one favorite color, I like different colors depending on my mood.. sometimes pink, sometimes black, sometimes blue. Favorite animal, I also dont really have a favorite? I like them all (most) for different reasons. Maybe I should of named this section "Factual information"?" Im 21 years old, 22 in march. Im a pisces if youre into that kinda thing. Born in port angeles washington, but I grew up in different citys! I have two brothers, one is 27, the other 11 and he passed July of 2024. Im currently a barista, but actively enrolled in a program to teach me Front end web development (hence why im writing this right now) </p>
   <h3>Hobbies and passions</h3>
   <p>I have many many hobbies and interests! First, I love to run. I run the track monday-friday after work, typically at night time. Its theraputic to me. Aside from running, I also like to go to the gym, but I normally go as a replacement if im not feeling the track, or its raining etc. In highschool, I used to competetively ride horses, I was part of the equestrian team! After highschool I moved to tacoma, and havent picked it back up since, but It'll always be a passion of mine! I love to read, I love to write, I love to paint and make art. Anything that requires creativity, Is my jam. I also love to play video games on my Xbox... and, shopping. I love to go shopping and spoil myself every now and then, retail therapy I think they call it.</p>
